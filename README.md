# 🚀 0G Chain Starter Projects  

This repository contains two starter projects built on the **0G Chain** — a decentralized, AI-first Layer 1 blockchain purpose-built for scalable inference and next-gen dApps.  

## 📌 Projects Included
1. **MemeCoin Smart Contract**  
   - A simple ERC-20 style token deployed on the 0G Chain.  
   - Perfect as a base for community-driven tokens or experimenting with tokenomics.  

2. **Chatbot with Inference SDK**  
   - A decentralized AI chatbot leveraging the **0G Inference SDK**.  
   - Demonstrates how on-chain AI inference can be integrated into applications for conversational AI.
